        Hello!
        
        in here im going to talk about my fist visual novle that i made for a school project :3.
        <a href="https://github.com/ZombieBunny333/How-to-murder-101">How-to-murder-101</a>
        here is the link for the game.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        the game was made in renpay whici is a more simple version of python.
        and the art is made by me :3 the game took me around 4 weeks to make ( which was the deadline to deliver the project) and it was the first time i made any thing like that and especially in renpay.
        there are some things that i wish i did differently and i might remake the game to make it better but thats for a fufter me to decide on 
    </p>
